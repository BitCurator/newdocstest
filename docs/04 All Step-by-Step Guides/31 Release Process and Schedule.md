# **Release Process and Schedule**

## ***BitCurator Consortium Software Development Committee***

*This page outlines a process by which issues identified in the public
[[BitCurator User
Forum]{.underline}](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcurator-users)
can be raised to the attention of BitCurator Consortium members for
possible action or resolution. A proposed software release schedule is
also outlined.*

## **Current Identification of Software Issues and Features**

-   Non-member users identify issues and post them to public BitCurator
    User Forum.

-   Member users identify issues and post in the BitCurator User Forum.

-   Members can also create new feature requests

## **Proposed Software Release Process**

1.  MONTHLY A designated site monitor reviews all posts on public
    BitCurator User Forum and generates a list to the BCC Software
    Development Committee, containing:

> · Frequently mentioned issues (those receiving a high number of
> views/responses)
>
> · High-priority issues that may document major bugs or other software
> issues
>
> · Feature requests that may be outcomes of ongoing user group
> communication

2.  MONTHLY Designated site monitor creates tickets for any User Forum
    issues that will be included for voting. The Software Development
    Committee briefly reviews and discusses these tickets during that
    group's monthly meeting.

3.  QUARTERLY A reminder to BCC members is put out for votes on issue
    list (votes and feedback are always available to members however).

4.  QUARTERLY The Software Development Committee reviews issue list and
    recommends features and fixes to be prioritized for Executive
    Council action. SDC recommendation can be either green/red/yellow,
    where:

> · RED is for fixes/features that are not recommended for the current
> or upcoming release cycle, or for features which are being removed
> from the suite due to incompatibilities or discontinuation of a tool,
> etc.
>
> · YELLOW is for fixes/features that are not recommended for the
> current release cycle but may be recommended for subsequent releases
> (with reasons for why not - could be dependencies, lack of funding,
> etc.)
>
> · GREEN is for fixes/features that are recommended for current release
> cycle, with reasons why, plus any additional information (i.e., should
> be included as a bounty, or requires external funding partnership for
> inclusion)
>
> · *NOTE: Prioritization should be as transparent as possible, with
> notes on justifications for recommendations provided for Executive
> Council and available to all BCC members.*

5.  The BCC Executive Council approves the SDC recommendation or
    discusses and proceeds to adjustments of the recommended plan.

6.  Development targets are announced for next quarterly release and
    linked to specific threads in the BitCurator user mailing list as
    warranted
