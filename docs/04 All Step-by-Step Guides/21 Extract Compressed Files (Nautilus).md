# **Extract Compressed Files (Nautilus)**

1.  Open Nautilus and navigate to the archive you would like to
    decompress.

2.  Right click on the file that has been compressed using zip or gzip.
    Select \'Open With Archive Manager\'. (Note that a compressed file
    type such as a zip file is often referred to as an \'archive\'
    within the Ubuntu Linux environment and technical communities.)

3.  A new window will open from which you can either browse the contents
    or extract them (see Figure 1).\
    ![](./media/image2.png){width="6.5in" height="5.375in"} **Figure

4.  Left click on the \'Extract\' button to extract the contents.

5.  Navigate to the location to which you would like the files extracted
    using the navigation window (see Figure 2).\

    **Figure 2**: Navigate to where you would like the file extracted
    and then click \'Extract\'.

6.  Left click the \'Extract\' button on the bottom right of the window
    to complete the process.
