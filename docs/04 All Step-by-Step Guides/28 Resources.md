### **Datasets Library**

The [<u>BitCuratorEdu</u>](http://bitcuratoredu.web.unc.edu/) project
team is building a library of datasets for educational, testing, and
research purposes.

This document summarizes known available sample data. If you know of
other examples that are already publicly available or how your own
examples that you would be willing to share, please let the
BitCuratorEdu project team know.

The team will continue to build this content as we gather it over the
2019-2021 project period.

#### **General Resources about Digital Forensics Sample Data**

A comprehensive review of available datasets for cyber forensics
research was presented at the 2017 Digital Forensics Research Workshop.

- See original article at
  [<u>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742287617301913</u>](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742287617301913)

- 81 datasets listed at:

#### **Digital Corpora**

- Nitroba University Harassment Scenario:

- M57-Patents Scenario:

  [<u>https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/disk-images/nps-2010-emails</u>](https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/disk-images/nps-2010-emails)

- Real Data Corpus (restricted access):
  [<u>https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/disk-images/real-data-corpus</u>](https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/disk-images/real-data-corpus)

This is arguably the most directly applicable and widely used source for
sample data in digital forensics education. Simson Garfinkel and his
collaborators have developed several realistic corpora for digital
forensics education and research, available at
[<u>http://digitalcorpora.org</u>](http://digitalcorpora.org/).

These include “scenarios,” which represent fictional but realistic
events. For example, UNC SILS frequently uses the M57-Patents Scenario
for classes and a variety of continuing education offerings, including
conference workshops and the Digital Archives Specialist (DAS) digital
forensics courses offered through the Society of American Archivists.
The full hard drive images are of a manageable size for longer
assignments and exercises that require a drive with a full operating
system; the USB flash drive images are smaller and well-suited for short
workshops, class exercises and demonstrations.

#### **CD-ROM and Floppy Disk Library – Indiana University**

Online collection of "nearly 5,000 CD-ROMs, DVDs, and floppy disks
distributed by the GPO under the Federal Depository Library Program
(FDLP). These tangible products have been received through the FDLP
since the 1980s and consist of millions of individual files containing
fundamental data on economics, the environment, population, and life and
physical sciences."

[<u>https://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/</u>](https://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/virtual_disk_library/)

Each disk image has an associated catalog record. For use in classes,
one approach is to share a subset of the images directly with students,
so they don’t immediately encounter all of the descriptive metadata from
the site.

#### **Preservation and Access Virtual Education Laboratory (PAVEL)**

The Preservation and Access Virtual Education Lab (PAVEL) project at the
University of Michigan School of Information (2010-2012), funded by the
National Endowment for the Humanities, developed a “virtual education
laboratory featuring digital access and preservation tools.” This
includes four data sets:

- a small set of six files for testing preservation tools (ZIP file, 6.1
  MB)

- Elena Kagan's email (approximately 19,000 messages) (ZIP file, 47.9
  MB) from her tenure in the White House, along with an organizational
  chart (PDF file, 161 KB) and staff list (PDF file, 119 KB)

- the [<u>Enron email
  collection</u>](https://ils.unc.edu/callee/enron-email/enron-email.zip)
  (approximately 600,000 messages) (ZIP file, 112.4 MB), along with
  organizational charts (PDF file, 214 KB)

- a [<u>set of
  documents</u>](https://ils.unc.edu/callee/lsa-it/lsa-it-data.zip) (ZIP
  file, 182.9 MB) from the University of Michigan College of Literature,
  Science, and the Arts IT department (approximately 450 megabytes of
  Microsoft Office files) and document providing institutional context
  (PDF file, 15 KB) information

Many thanks to David Wallace and Beth Yakel from the PAVEL team for
allowing us to redistribute the datasets.

PAVEL data sets have the advantage of being selected for use in archival
education, and they contain important supplementary information (e.g.
organizational charts) for understanding their contexts of creation.
However, they do not allow for the replication of many forensic tasks.
For example, all of the email messages are stored as separate ASCII text
files, rather than being embedded in a disk image or within a wrapper
format such as PST, a scenario likely to be encountered during
acquisition of a new collection.

#### **Corpora Designed for Targeted System Testing**

Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST):

#### **Open Preservation Foundation**

The Open Preservation Foundation maintains a site that includes
“Datasets, preservation and curation Issues with those Datasets, and
Solutions to those Issues.” The experiences of solving specific Issues
are written up on Solution pages, which then link to pages in the OPF
Tool Registry. In many cases, this leads to “actual code that can be
downloaded and re-used.”

#### **National Institute of Standards and Technology**

The National Institute of Standards and Technology creates and maintains
data sets including disk images for testing forensic tools. Some of
these are deprecated over time; the current list can be found at:

#### **Library of Congress Labs Web Archive Data Sets**

The 1000 .gov PDF Datasets provided by LC are a particularly useful
dataset for exploring BitCurator functionality and can be applied to
educational contexts.

### **OSSArcFlow Resources**

The [<u>OSSArcFlow</u>](https://educopia.org/ossarcflow/) project
(2017-2020) was supported by a grant from the Institute of Museum and
Library Services. OSSArcFlow project personnel worked with partner
institutions to document and analyze born-digital workflows, and created
an implementation guide and videos to support workflow documentation and
analysis.

- [<u>Digital
  Dossiers</u>](https://educopia.org/ossarcflow-digital-dossier-all-dossiers/):
  Project partners created digital dossiers outlining the form,
  function, and future of digital curation at their home institutions.

- [<u>As-Is
  Workflows</u>](https://educopia.org/ossarcflow-as-is-all-workflows/):
  In the fall of 2017, the project team worked with partners at each
  institution to mockup a visual representation of their current
  workflow activities. Representing a “snapshot in time,” these
  documents show how a diverse group of institutions are using OSS tools
  in their workflows to curate born-digital content. They also provide
  an essential starting point for synthesizing and comparing both the
  gaps and overlaps that currently exist between common OSS tools and
  environments.

- [*<u>Guide to Documenting Born-Digital
  Workflows</u>*](https://educopia.org/ossarcflow-guide/): The purpose
  of the *Guide to Documenting Born-Digital Archival Workflows* is to
  encourage and assist collecting institutions of all shapes, sizes, and
  types to begin documenting their born-digital workflows. The *Guide*
  includes four main sections:

  1.  **Introduction** – provides a brief background of the project, the
      research questions that have driven our inquiry, and how to use
      this *Guide* in your own work as an archivist and curator of
      born-digital collections.

  2.  **Common Steps in OSS Born-Digital Archival Workflows** – provides
      brief descriptions of each of the main steps in born-digital
      archiving (13 in total) and what tools are commonly used to
      accomplish each of these steps today.

  3.  **Documenting Born-Digital Workflows** – provides detailed
      guidance to help you use the OSSArcFlow survey, interview
      questions, and visualization model to document and depict your own
      workflow.

  4.  **Using Workflows** – provides guidance and examples of how an
      institution can use its existing workflows to identify
      growth/maturity goals, to advocate for resources, and to transform
      roles/relationships as needed to improve its born-digital
      archiving practices.
