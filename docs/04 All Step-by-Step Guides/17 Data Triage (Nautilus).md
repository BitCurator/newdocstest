# **Data Triage (Nautilus)**

Nautilus (see Figure 1) is a popular GUI file manager for Linux and is
the default file manager in Ubuntu Linux 12.04. It functions similarly
to *Windows Explorer* on Windows systems and *Finder* on Macs. One key
feature of Nautilus is the ability to add custom functionality by
incorporating user-created [[back-end
scripts]{.underline}](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NautilusScriptsHowto).
These scripts work much like plug-ins for a web browser and extend
Nautilus\'s basic functionality. We have included a number of custom
Nautilus scripts in the BitCurator Environment specifically geared to
assist the digital archivist in pre-ingest data analysis. See below for
specific instruction on how to use Nautilus to perform a number of
critical data analysis tasks.
