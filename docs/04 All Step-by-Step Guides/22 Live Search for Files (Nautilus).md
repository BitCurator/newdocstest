# **Live Search for Files (Nautilus)**

## **Search for files by either name or content**

1.  Open the Nautilus file browser

2.  Right click anywhere within the browser and select Scripts \> Find
    Files (see Figure 1).  
    <img src="./media/image1.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.36111in" />
    **Figure 1**: Choose which of the Find Files options works best for
    your search.

3.  Select either "Find by Content" or "Find by Name", depending on your
    search requirements.

4.  After the find interface opens, type your search terms into the
    search window (see Figure 2).  
      
    <img src="./media/image2.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.63889in" />  
    **Figure 2**: Enter your search terms in the appropriate window.

## **Search for images recursively from the present directory**

1.  Open the Nautilus file browser.

2.  Navigate to the top of the directory tree you would like to search.
    (Example: to search for all images in a users home directory,
    navigate to /home/\[username\])

3.  Right click anywhere within Nautilus and select Scripts \> Find
    Files \> Find Images (recursively).

4.  Nautilus will open a new window and create a temp directory with
    symlinks to all of the images found in the directory/directories you
    searched.

5.  Click 'No' when asked if you would like to delete the new temp
    directory (see Figure 3).  
    <img src="./media/image3.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.08333in" />
    **Figure 3**: Click 'No' when asked if you would like to delete the
    temp directory.
