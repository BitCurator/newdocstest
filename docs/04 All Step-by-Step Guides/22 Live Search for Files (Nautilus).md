## **Search for images recursively from the present directory**

1.  Open the Nautilus file browser.

    (Example: to search for all images in a users home directory,
    navigate to /home/\[username\])

3.  Right click anywhere within Nautilus and select Scripts \> Find
    Files \> Find Images (recursively).

4.  Nautilus will open a new window and create a temp directory with
    symlinks to all of the images found in the directory/directories you
    searched.

5.  Click \'No\' when asked if you would like to delete the new temp
    directory (see Figure 3).\
