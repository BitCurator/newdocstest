**Forensic Reports**
====================

**Overview**
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The culmination of the previous steps in the BitCurator process result
in the BitCurator Forensic Reports. These reports bring together the
various outputs from bulk_extractor, fiwalk and the annotation tool to
generate both machine and human readable reports that can be read
directly or crosswalked to other archival tools.

**Step-by-Step Guide**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Open the BitCurator Reporting Tool by double clicking on the
   "Forensics Tools" folder on the BitCurator desktop and then double
   clicking on the "BitCurator Reporting Tool" icon.

2. Once the BitCurator Reporting Tool finishes opening, select the
   "Reports" tab from the options along the top (see Figure 1).

..

   3. Type or navigate to the location of the following files or
   directories (see Figure 1):

1. Fiwalk XML File: The location of the DFXML output from running
   fiwalk.

2. Annotated Features Files Directory: The directory containing the
   output from the Annotated Features report

3. Output Directory For Reports (new): A new directory created by the
   BitCurator Reporting Tool to contain the BitCurator forensics
   reports. *Note*: if you use the navigation button to select this
   directory, type the name of the new directory in the "Name:" field on
   the top left of the window. Do not use the "Create Folder" button on
   the right to create this new directory. (see Figure 2).

4. | Config File (optional): For additional configuration files;
     generally left empty.

   | **Figure 2**: Type the name of the new directory in the "Name"
     field.

   4. Once each of the file and directory fields above are properly
   filled out, click the "Run" button. The activity bar on the bottom
   left will indicated that the report generation process is still
   ongoing. Once complete, a success or error message will appear in the
   "Command Line Output" window (see Figure 3).

   created.

   5. Completion of the steps above generates the following files in the
   directory you specified under "Output Directory" in Step 3:

   o features (directory): the annotated features

   o bc_format_bargraph.pdf (file): the format histogram

   o bulk_extractor_report.pdf (file): high-level overview of feature
   locations on disk

   o fiwalk_deleted_files.pdf (file): shows paths to any deleted
   materials found in a given partition

   o fiwalk-output.xml.xlsx (file): Excel converted DFXML output (file
   system metadata)

   o fiwalk_report.pdf (file): High-level overview of file system
   characteristics

   o format_table.pdf (file): Long-form file format names for formats
   shown in bargraph

   o premis.xml (file): PREMIS preservation metadata

   Open the BitCurator reports directory to examine the files. Youâ€™ll
   find visualizations, XLSX transcriptions of file system metadata,
   high-level reports on file types, and overviews of features
   identified by bulk_extractor.
