**Package files and metadata with Bagger**
==========================================

Bagger is no longer included in the BitCurator Environment. It can still
be installed in the environment - see the `project
website <https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagger>`__ for more
details.

**Overview:**

The `Bagger software <https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagger>`__
from the Library of Congress, provides a GUI application for creating
and working with packages that conform to the `BagIt
specification <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-17>`__.
This application can be installed on BitCurator following instructions
on the `project's page <https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagger>`__.

**Step By Step:**
-----------------

**Step 1:** To begin creating a bag, click to 'Create a new bag' and
select an existing profile to start with a set of predefined metadata
fields or start with no profile to define your own.

**Step 4**: Click the 'Save Bag As' link, providing a name and location
for the bag. Select the algorithm used for generating hashes that will
be used for fixity checking, and click ok. You will receive an on-screen
notification that the bag has been successfully created.
