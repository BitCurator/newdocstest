# New Docs Test

Test instance to demo what it will look to migrate from Google Docs to GitHub Pages.

The `Formatting test` page is offered to directly demonstrate what formatting features available in Google Docs will or won't be preserved after migrating to Markdown (for GitHub Pages based on Jekyll, the default) or RestructuredText (the format used by ReadTheDocs).

For a given page in Google Docs, visit the corresponding page in GitHub Pages or under the `rst` folder to see if any essential formatting is lost.
